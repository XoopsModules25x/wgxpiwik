wgxPiwik - implementatition of Piwik in your Xoops

This simple module is for implementation of Piwik to your Xoops website.
•Piwik is included in the module
•Installing Piwik can be started from module, but you can't admin Piwik himself (create user, admin user rights,...) via this module. You have to use Piwik admin ui.
•You can provide Piwik Charts/Widgets via iframe on user site. As Piwik function 'logme' is used, therefore no separate login for your users is necessary.
•The permissions for Xoops User you can set per group in the module
•Tracking will be done via a block. Therefore you can activate tracking only for specific modules, all modules or only the startpage.
