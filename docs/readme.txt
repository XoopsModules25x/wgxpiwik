Read Me First
=============
This module is for implementation of Piwik to your Xoops.

* Piwik is included in the module
* Installing Piwik can be started from module, but you can't admin Piwik himself (create user, admin user rights,...) via this module. You have to use Piwik admin ui.
* You can provide Piwik Charts/Widgets via iframe on user site. As Piwik function 'logme' is used, therefore no separate login for your users is necessary.
* The permissions for Xoops User you can set per group in the module
* Tracking will be done via a block. Therefore you can activate tracking only for specific modules, all modules or only the startpage.
